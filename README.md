# biotope-sensitivity
This project aims to assign sensitivities of benthic biotopes to the habitat map. This is a sub-project within the larger project: Fishing Displacement

The purpose of the code is to develop spatial layers indicating the sensitivities of various fine-scale benthic biotopes to respective pressures resulting from a range of activities. The code needs to join activity-pressure-sensitivity data to GIS map of benthic biotopes. The code will extract the GIS and Access database data from their sources, then associate finescale benthic habitat to broad-scale habitat (based on sub biogeoregional zones), and the rejoin the now wrangled-data (Sub-biogeoregional Biotope Activity Pressure Sensitivity) to the GIS data.
